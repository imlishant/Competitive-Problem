a boy caught thefting, to save himself he creates an unknown normal chor who is never been caught so never been seen. only dark sillouhette of body with white iris moving.
now everytime he does that, he started marking this imaginary chor signature.
jail me koharam mach jata, ki this chor is fararr. but the boy is outside only, and he has already created a dual personality. he transform to that. chowki me apna aadhar card dikha kr bahar bhaag jata hai.







why everytime we meet and have this much vulnerability, its always the last day. why??
i don't know, we just started sharing, when we think we are connecting, our shadows start appearing..
this whole night of solitude, just us.
we both have been through a lot. u and I.
we gonna be alone once more, more so than that, we'll be lost in our thoughts again and lonley again.
we wasted so much time being apart, we regret.
but every moment become precious bcoz u linger in that thought.

####
ruk kar roya zarur,
bardad hue lamho pr.
phir khushi se jhum bhi utha,
unn beetein lamho me tehere to aap hi the.
shayad mil agr paayein,
to ye kahiyega khayal se,
mile the jahan hum dono,
wo sapna nhi tha.. keh do.



a veg-rakshak ki kahani.
